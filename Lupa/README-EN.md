# Lupa

[ *[PT-BR](./README.md)* | EN ]

Lupa plugin is a call manager for groups, in which you can list in a window those calls that happen in the /LFF (Looking For Fellow) channel and send a direct message to the message owner, just by clicking a send button, to let you inform the owner that you want to join the group.

- Extract downloaded Lupa plugin in directory: `%HOMEPATH%\Documents\The Lord of the Rings Online\Plugins\`
- Rename the extracted directory so that it is named GuardioesDeArda, without version sufix, ie: `%HOMEPATH%\Documents\The Lord of the Rings Online\Plugins\GuardioesDeArda`

## Using
To open the main window, use the `/lupa` command and wait for a group to appear so that you can request to join, just by clicking on the button that appears on the side.
Be aware that not all calls will show up, as it is not always possible to interpret what people type, Lupa needs a minimum standard to detect that what is being said on the /LFF channel is really a group call.
